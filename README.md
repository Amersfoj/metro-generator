## Metro generator
A simple collection of functions to generate a working powered rail system. Use the functions in chat to create metro tunnels underground or elevated. There is one command for a tunnel in each cardinal direction (north, east et cetera).

Obviously you will need Allow Cheats or simply be in Creative mode which I have been testing it on. 

Spawn a tunnel by calling the functions in chat:
```
/function metro:north
/function metro:east
/function metro:south
/function metro:west
/function metro:station
````
